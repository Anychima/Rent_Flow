# Property Availability Filtering Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of property availability filtering to prevent properties with active or pending leases from appearing on public listings, and to show status indicators for properties undergoing lease/payment processes.

## Problem Statement
Previously, properties with signed leases, active leases, or pending payments were still showing up on the public property listings page. This created confusion for prospective tenants who might apply for properties that are no longer available.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (`backend/src/index.ts`)

#### Updated `/api/properties/public` Endpoint
The endpoint now:
- Fetches properties with their associated lease information
- Filters out properties with active or pending leases
- Enriches each property with an `availability_status` field
- Only returns truly available properties to the public

**Lease Statuses Filtered Out:**
- `active` - Property currently rented
- `pending_tenant` - Waiting for tenant signature
- `pending_landlord` - Waiting for landlord/manager signature  
- `fully_signed` - Lease signed but not yet active

**Code Flow:**
```javascript
1. Fetch all active properties with their leases
2. For each property:
   - Check for active/pending leases
   - Determine availability status
   - Add availability_status field
3. Filter out properties that are not 'available'
4. Return only available properties
```

**Availability Status Values:**
- `available` - Property is truly available for rent
- `pending_tenant_signature` - Tenant is in the signing process
- `pending_landlord_signature` - Manager is reviewing
- `lease_signed` - Lease fully signed, being processed
- `rented` - Property has an active lease

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "property-uuid",
      "title": "Modern Downtown Apartment",
      "availability_status": "available",
      // ... other property fields
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/components/PublicPropertyListings.tsx`)

#### Updated Property Interface
Added `availability_status` field to the Property TypeScript interface:
```typescript
interface Property {
  // ... existing fields
  availability_status?: 'available' | 'pending_tenant_signature' | 
                       'pending_landlord_signature' | 'lease_signed' | 'rented';
}
```

#### Added Status Badge Display
Implemented a visual status badge system on property cards:

**Badge Configuration:**
- **Available** - Green badge with ‚úì icon
- **Tenant Signing** - Yellow badge with ‚úçÔ∏è icon  
- **Manager Review** - Orange badge with üìã icon
- **Processing** - Blue badge with ‚è≥ icon
- **Rented** - Gray badge with üè† icon (won't show as filtered out)

**Badge Positioning:**
The status badge appears in the top-right corner of the property image, next to the save button.

**Visual Implementation:**
```tsx
<div className={`absolute top-3 right-16 ${statusBadge.bgColor} text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-semibold shadow-lg flex items-center gap-1`}>
  <span>{statusBadge.icon}</span>
  <span>{statusBadge.label}</span>
</div>
```

## Database Schema Reference

### Leases Table - `lease_status` Column
```sql
lease_status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft' CHECK (lease_status IN (
    'draft',           -- Generated but not signed
    'pending_tenant',  -- Waiting for tenant signature
    'pending_landlord',-- Waiting for landlord signature  
    'fully_signed',    -- Both parties signed
    'active',          -- Lease is active
    'expired',         -- Lease term ended
    'terminated'       -- Lease terminated early
))
```

The system checks both `lease_status` (new) and `status` (legacy) columns for backward compatibility.

## Benefits

### For Prospective Tenants
‚úÖ No confusion about property availability  
‚úÖ Don't waste time applying for unavailable properties  
‚úÖ Clear visual indicators of property status  
‚úÖ Better user experience on public listings

### For Property Managers
‚úÖ Reduces invalid applications  
‚úÖ Less time spent rejecting applications for unavailable properties  
‚úÖ Cleaner, more professional public listings  
‚úÖ Automatic availability management

### For System Integrity
‚úÖ Properties automatically become unavailable when leases are signed  
‚úÖ Properties automatically become available when leases expire  
‚úÖ Consistent state across the application  
‚úÖ Real-time availability updates

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Call `/api/properties/public` endpoint
- [ ] Verify only available properties are returned
- [ ] Check that `availability_status` field is present
- [ ] Confirm properties with active leases are filtered out
- [ ] Confirm properties with pending leases are filtered out

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Load public property listings page
- [ ] Verify status badges appear on property cards
- [ ] Check that badge colors match the status
- [ ] Confirm rented properties don't appear
- [ ] Verify properties in signing process show appropriate badges

### Integration Testing
1. **Create a new lease** for a property
2. **Sign as tenant** - Property should show "Manager Review" badge
3. **Sign as manager** - Property should disappear from public listings
4. **Complete payment** - Property status should be "active"
5. **Verify** property doesn't appear on public listings

## Edge Cases Handled

### Multiple Leases for Same Property
- Backend checks for ANY active/pending leases
- Returns the first matching lease status
- Ensures property is hidden if any lease is in progress

### Backward Compatibility
- Checks both `lease_status` (new) and `status` (legacy) columns
- Uses `lease_status` if available, falls back to `status`
- Works with existing data without migration

### Missing Lease Data
- Properties with no leases default to 'available'
- Gracefully handles null/undefined lease arrays
- Safe fallback to available status if data is missing

## Performance Considerations

### Database Query Optimization
- Single query with join to fetch properties + leases
- Uses existing indexes on `leases` table
- Filtering done in application layer (not database) for flexibility

### Frontend Performance
- Status badge calculation happens once per property card render
- Memoization not needed as calculation is simple
- No additional API calls required

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket connection to update status badges live
2. **Status Filter** - Allow filtering by availability status on public page
3. **Waitlist Feature** - Allow users to join waitlist for properties in signing
4. **Notification System** - Notify users when property becomes available
5. **Analytics** - Track how many users view unavailable properties

### Database Optimizations
1. Add computed column for `is_available` on properties table
2. Create database trigger to update availability on lease changes
3. Add index on `availability_status` for faster filtering

## Troubleshooting

### Properties Still Showing When They Shouldn't
**Check:**
1. Lease has correct `lease_status` value
2. Lease is linked to correct property via `property_id`
3. Backend server has been restarted with new code
4. Browser cache has been cleared

### Status Badges Not Displaying
**Check:**
1. Frontend has imported `useState` and `useEffect` from React
2. `availability_status` field is present in API response
3. Badge positioning CSS is correct (not covered by other elements)
4. Browser console for any errors

### Incorrect Status Displayed
**Check:**
1. Lease status in database matches expected value
2. Status mapping in `getStatusBadge()` function is correct
3. Backend is checking both `lease_status` and `status` columns
4. No conflicting leases for the same property
