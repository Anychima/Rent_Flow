## 📝 Developer Notes

### Database Schema
The system uses the following tables:
- `users` - Tenant profiles
- `leases` - Rental agreements
- `maintenance_requests` - Maintenance tickets (field: `requested_by`)
- `rent_payments` - Payment records (NOT `payments`)
- `properties` - Property details

### Key Endpoints
```
GET  /api/tenant/:tenantId/dashboard
POST /api/tenant/:tenantId/maintenance
GET  /api/tenant/:tenantId/payments
POST /api/tenant/:tenantId/payments/initiate
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in via Supabase Auth
2. AuthContext fetches user profile from database
3. If Auth ID ≠ DB ID, fallback to email lookup
4. UserProfile contains role for routing
5. Tenant role → TenantDashboard
6. Manager/Admin role → Dashboard

- ✅ Maintenance form submission works
