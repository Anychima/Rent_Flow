# Fix: Manager Property Isolation

## üéØ Problem

ALL managers were seeing ALL properties in the system instead of only their own properties. This breaks the multi-manager platform model where different property managers should only manage their own listings.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (`backend/src/index.ts`)

**Modified `/api/properties` endpoint** (Line ~51):
- Now accepts `manager_id` query parameter
- Filters properties by `owner_id` when `manager_id` is provided
- Returns all properties (public view) when no `manager_id` provided

```typescript
app.get('/api/properties', async (req, res) => {
  const { manager_id } = req.query;
  
  let query = supabase
    .from('properties')
    .select('*')
    .eq('is_active', true);

  // Filter by manager if provided
  if (manager_id) {
    query = query.eq('owner_id', manager_id);
  }
  
  // Return filtered results
})
```

### 2. Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)

**Modified `fetchData()` function** (Line ~589):
- Now passes logged-in manager's ID when fetching properties
- Properties URL: `/api/properties?manager_id={userProfile.id}`
- Only fetches manager's own properties for dashboard

**Modified `handlePropertySubmit()` function** (Line ~254):
- New properties now use `userProfile.id` as `owner_id`
- No more hardcoded default manager ID
- Each manager's properties are linked to their user ID

### 3. Added userProfile to Dashboard Component

**Line ~135**:
```typescript
const { user, userProfile, signOut } = useAuth();
```

Now Dashboard has access to logged-in user's profile including their ID.

## üîß How It Works Now

### Manager Creates Property:
1. Manager logs in
2. Creates new property
3. Property is saved with `owner_id = manager's user ID`
4. Property only appears in THAT manager's dashboard

### Manager Views Dashboard:
1. Manager logs in
2. Dashboard fetches: `/api/properties?manager_id={their_id}`
3. Backend filters: `WHERE owner_id = manager_id`
4. Manager sees ONLY their properties

### New Manager Account:
1. New manager signs up
2. Logs in to dashboard
3. Sees EMPTY properties list (correct!)
4. Can add their own properties
5. Those properties are isolated to their account

---

## üìä Database Schema

Properties table has `owner_id` field:

```sql
CREATE TABLE properties (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  owner_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),  -- Links to manager
  title TEXT,
  address TEXT,
  -- ... other fields
);
```

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test Case 1: Existing Manager

```sql
-- Check which properties belong to which manager
SELECT 
  u.email as manager_email,
  u.role,
  COUNT(p.id) as property_count,
  array_agg(p.title) as properties
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN properties p ON p.owner_id = u.id
WHERE u.role = 'manager'
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.role;
```

**Expected**: Each manager shows only their own properties

### Test Case 2: New Manager

1. Create new manager account
2. Login
3. Go to dashboard
4. **Expected**: Zero properties shown
5. Add a new property
6. **Expected**: Only that property appears

### Test Case 3: Property Creation

```sql
-- Verify new properties have correct owner_id
SELECT 
  p.id,
  p.title,
  p.owner_id,
  u.email as owner_email
FROM properties p
JOIN users u ON u.id = p.owner_id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected**: Each property's `owner_id` matches the manager who created it

---

## üîç Verification Scripts

### Check Current Property Distribution

```sql
-- See how properties are distributed among managers
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN owner_id IS NULL THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è NO OWNER'
    ELSE owner_id::text
  END as owner_id,
  u.email as manager_email,
  COUNT(*) as properties_count
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = p.owner_id
GROUP BY owner_id, u.email
ORDER BY properties_count DESC;
```

### Fix Orphaned Properties (if any)

```sql
-- Find properties without an owner
SELECT id, title, address, created_at
FROM properties
WHERE owner_id IS NULL;

-- Assign to a specific manager (replace with actual manager ID)
UPDATE properties
SET owner_id = 'MANAGER_USER_ID_HERE'
WHERE owner_id IS NULL;
```

### Verify Manager Isolation

```sql
-- Test query that simulates what backend does
-- Replace MANAGER_ID with actual manager's user ID
SELECT *
FROM properties
WHERE owner_id = 'MANAGER_ID_HERE'
  AND is_active = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## üö® Important Notes

### For Existing Data:

If you have existing properties that were created before this fix, they might:
- Have `owner_id = NULL`
- Have wrong `owner_id` (all pointing to one manager)

**Fix existing data**:

```sql
-- Option 1: Assign all existing properties to first manager
UPDATE properties p
SET owner_id = (
  SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'manager' ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1
)
WHERE owner_id IS NULL;

-- Option 2: Manually assign each property to correct manager
UPDATE properties
SET owner_id = 'SPECIFIC_MANAGER_ID'
WHERE id = 'PROPERTY_ID';
```

### For Multi-Manager Feature:

If you want to add co-managers (multiple managers for one property):
1. Create `property_managers` junction table
2. Link properties to multiple managers
3. Update backend query to use `JOIN` instead of `WHERE owner_id =`

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The fix is working correctly when:

1. ‚úÖ New manager signs up ‚Üí sees empty dashboard
2. ‚úÖ New manager creates property ‚Üí only they see it
3. ‚úÖ Existing manager ‚Üí sees only their properties
4. ‚úÖ Different managers ‚Üí don't see each other's properties
5. ‚úÖ Public property listing ‚Üí shows all active properties
6. ‚úÖ Property creation ‚Üí auto-assigns to logged-in manager

---

## üìù API Endpoints

### Manager Dashboard (Private):
```
GET /api/properties?manager_id={userId}
Returns: Only properties owned by that manager
```

### Public Listing (No Auth):
```
GET /api/properties/public
Returns: All active properties (for tenant browsing)
```

### Create Property:
```
POST /api/properties
Body: { ...propertyData, owner_id: userProfile.id }
Returns: Created property linked to manager
```

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Run verification script** to check current property ownership
2. **Fix orphaned properties** (if any exist)
3. **Test with new manager account**:
   - Create new manager
   - Verify empty dashboard
   - Add property
   - Verify it appears
4. **Test with existing manager**:
   - Login
   - Verify they only see their properties
   - Verify count matches database

## üîê Security Considerations

### RLS (Row Level Security) in Supabase:

Consider adding RLS policies to enforce at database level:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on properties table
ALTER TABLE properties ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Managers can only see their own properties
CREATE POLICY "Managers see own properties"
ON properties
FOR SELECT
USING (
  auth.uid() = owner_id
  OR is_active = true  -- Allow public viewing of active properties
);

-- Policy: Managers can only insert properties for themselves
CREATE POLICY "Managers create own properties"
ON properties
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = owner_id);

-- Policy: Managers can only update their own properties
CREATE POLICY "Managers update own properties"
ON properties
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);
```

---

## üí° Additional Features to Consider

1. **Property Transfer**: Allow transferring property ownership between managers
2. **Co-Management**: Multiple managers for one property
3. **Property Groups**: Manager creates sub-managers for property portfolios
4. **Audit Trail**: Track property ownership changes

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Before**:
- All managers saw all properties
- New manager saw existing properties
- Properties had hardcoded owner ID

**After**:
- Each manager sees only their properties
- New manager sees empty dashboard
- Properties auto-linked to creator
- Multi-manager platform ready

This fix enables the true multi-tenant property management platform where independent managers can list and manage their own properties!
