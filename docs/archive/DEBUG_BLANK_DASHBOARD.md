# üîç Debug Blank Dashboard - Immediate Actions

## CRITICAL: I need to see what's happening

Since the dashboard is still blank, I need you to do this RIGHT NOW:

### Step 1: Open Browser Console (REQUIRED)

1. Open the app: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. **CLEAR the console** (click the üö´ icon)
5. Login as `manager@rentflow.ai`
6. **Take a screenshot** of EVERYTHING in the console
7. **Copy ALL the console text** and send it to me

### Step 2: Check the exact routing logs

In the console, look for these EXACT lines:

```
==================================================
üîÄ [App.tsx] Routing Decision for User:
   Email: ???
   Profile Role: ???
==================================================
```

**Tell me:**
- What does "Profile Role" say? (manager/tenant/prospective_tenant/null/undefined?)
- Do you see "Showing Manager Dashboard" or something else?

### Step 3: Check Network Tab

1. In DevTools, go to **Network** tab
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Look for RED failed requests
4. Tell me which endpoints are failing:
   - `/api/dashboard/stats` - Status?
   - `/api/properties` - Status?
   - `/api/applications` - Status?

### Step 4: Did you run the SQL fix?

**CRITICAL**: Did you run this in Supabase SQL Editor?

```sql
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'manager'
WHERE email = 'manager@rentflow.ai';
```

If NOT, **DO IT NOW** then try again.

### Step 5: Verify in Supabase Database

Go to Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí users table ‚Üí Find manager@rentflow.ai

**Tell me what you see in the "role" column**:
- [ ] Says "manager" 
- [ ] Says "tenant"
- [ ] Says "prospective_tenant"
- [ ] Is empty/NULL
- [ ] Column doesn't exist

## Quick Test Commands

Run these in PowerShell and tell me the results:

```powershell
# Test 1: Stats endpoint
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard/stats" -UseBasicParsing).Content

# Test 2: Applications endpoint  
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/applications" -UseBasicParsing).Content

# Test 3: Properties endpoint
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/properties" -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

**For each test, tell me:**
- ‚úÖ Success - returns data
- ‚ùå Error - what error?

## What "Blank Dashboard" Means

When you say "blank dashboard", do you mean:

**A)** Completely white/empty screen with nothing?
**B)** Header shows but content area is empty?
**C)** You see the dashboard tabs but no data in them?
**D)** You see a loading spinner that never stops?
**E)** You're redirected to a different page?

**Tell me EXACTLY what you see on screen.**

## Most Likely Issues (in order)

### Issue 1: Role not fixed in database (90% likely)
