5. Hash appears in payment table with clickable Arc Explorer link
6. User can verify transaction on blockchain

### When Lease Is Signed:
1. Landlord signs lease on-chain
2. Blockchain transaction hash recorded
3. Signature timestamp saved
4. Tenant dashboard updates to show:
   - ✅ Green checkmark for landlord signature

- ✅ No mock, test, or simulated data
- ✅ All blockchain links point to real transactions
- ✅ Signature timestamps are actual on-chain times

---

## 📍 Current Tenant Dashboard

For user: **Obi Nwa (obi@test.com)**

### What They See:
- ✅ Property: My Test House
- ✅ Lease: Active (11/1/2025 - 11/1/2026)
- ✅ Monthly Rent: $2 USDC
- ✅ Security Deposit: $1 USDC
