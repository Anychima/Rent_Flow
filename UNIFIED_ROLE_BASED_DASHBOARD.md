# 🎯 Unified Role-Based Dashboard System

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
- ❌ Multiple separate dashboards per role (fragmented UX)
- ❌ Standalone ManagerApplicationDashboard component
- ❌ No clear routing for prospective tenants
- ❌ Duplicate functionality across components

### Solution
- ✅ **Single unified manager dashboard** with integrated application management
- ✅ **Role-based routing** automatically directs users to correct view
- ✅ **Consolidated functionality** - one dashboard per role type
- ✅ **Clear separation** between prospective tenants, tenants, and managers
