# üîß Auto-Wallet Connection Removed - Final Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Issue**: Wallet was still being auto-created/connected for users  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üêõ Problem Identified

**User Report**: "joel@test.com" account had wallet automatically created when trying to sign lease

**Root Cause**: Auto-reconnection logic in `LeaseSigningPage.tsx` (lines 112-152) was:
- Checking if user had previously used a wallet
- Automatically reconnecting to that wallet
- Fetching wallet details from backend
- Setting wallet as connected WITHOUT user action

This violated the requirement that **users must explicitly choose** to connect a wallet.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/LeaseSigningPage.tsx`

### Removed Auto-Connection Logic

**BEFORE** (Lines 112-152):
```typescript
// Auto-connect to their previous Arc wallet if available
if (leaseData.tenant_wallet_type === 'circle' && leaseData.tenant_wallet_id) {
  console.log('üîó [Auto-Connect] Reconnecting to Arc wallet:', leaseData.tenant_wallet_id);
  setArcWalletId(leaseData.tenant_wallet_id);
  
  // ... 40 lines of auto-connection code ...
  // Fetches wallet from API
  // Sets wallet as connected
  // Updates user profile
}
```

**AFTER** (Lines 112-114):
```typescript
// DO NOT auto-connect wallet - user must choose to connect manually
console.log('‚ÑπÔ∏è [Payment Check] User must connect wallet manually to make payments');
```

## üéØ How It Works Now

### Lease Signing Flow:

1. **User navigates to lease signing page**
   - Lease loads
   - No wallet connection happens
   - User sees "Connect Arc Wallet" button

2. **User wants to sign lease**
   - Clicks "Connect Arc Wallet" button
   - **Wallet Connection Modal appears**
   - User chooses:
     - **Option A**: Create new Circle-managed wallet
     - **Option B**: Connect existing Arc wallet address

3. **After wallet connected**
   - Wallet shown as connected
   - "Sign with Arc" button becomes active
   - User can sign lease

4. **Payment Section**
   - Only appears AFTER wallet is connected
   - User can make payments with chosen wallet

---

## ‚úÖ Current Behavior (Correct)

### On Lease Signing Page:
- ‚úÖ NO automatic wallet detection
- ‚úÖ NO automatic wallet connection
- ‚úÖ NO automatic wallet creation
- ‚úÖ User MUST click "Connect Arc Wallet"
- ‚úÖ Modal shows both options (create OR connect)
- ‚úÖ User makes explicit choice

### On Payment:
- ‚úÖ Payment section hidden until wallet connected
- ‚úÖ User must connect wallet first
- ‚úÖ Same modal with same choices

### On Signup:
- ‚úÖ NO wallet field
- ‚úÖ NO wallet creation
- ‚úÖ Clean signup flow

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Behavior

### User Without Wallet:
```sql
SELECT wallet_address, circle_wallet_id, wallet_type 
FROM users WHERE email = 'joel@test.com';

-- Result:
-- wallet_address: NULL
-- circle_wallet_id: NULL
-- wallet_type: NULL
```

### User After Creating Circle Wallet:
```sql
-- Only after user EXPLICITLY creates wallet via modal
-- wallet_address: '0x1234...'
-- circle_wallet_id: 'abc-123...'
-- wallet_type: 'circle'
```

### User After Connecting External Wallet:
```sql
-- Only after user EXPLICITLY connects wallet via modal
-- wallet_address: '0x5678...'
-- circle_wallet_id: NULL
-- wallet_type: 'external'
```
