## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Lease not found" error

**Cause**: Trying to create payment for non-existent or inactive lease

**Solution**:
1. Verify lease exists: `GET /api/leases/{lease_id}`
2. Check lease status is "active"
3. Use valid lease ID from active leases list

### Issue: "Amount must be between $0.01 and $10" for micropayment

**Cause**: Micropayment amount outside allowed range

**Solution**:
- Minimum: $0.01
- Maximum: $10.00
- For amounts > $10, use regular payment endpoint

### Issue: "Invalid date format"

**Cause**: Date not in YYYY-MM-DD format

**Solution**:
```javascript
// ✅ Correct
due_date: "2025-11-01"

// ❌ Incorrect
due_date: "11/01/2025"
due_date: "Nov 1, 2025"
```

### Issue: Payment form shows "No active leases available"

**Cause**: No active leases in the system

**Solution**:
1. Create a property first
2. Create a lease for that property
3. Set lease status to "active"
4. Refresh payment form

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always validate on both frontend and backend**
   - Frontend: Better UX with immediate feedback
   - Backend: Security and data integrity

2. **Use meaningful error messages**
   - ✅ "Amount must be between $0.01 and $10 USDC"
   - ❌ "Invalid input"

3. **Log everything for debugging**
   - Use console.log with emojis for easy scanning
   - Include context (IDs, amounts, dates)

4. **Test edge cases**
   - $0, $0.01, maximum values
   - Empty strings, null, undefined
   - Invalid date formats

5. **Automate repetitive tasks**
   - Monthly payment generation
   - Overdue marking
   - Reminder sending
