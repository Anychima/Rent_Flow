# ✅ FINAL FIX APPLIED - **ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED!**

## 🎯 **ROOT CAUSE:**

The `.env` file was **MISSING** the `LEASE_SIGNATURE_CONTRACT` environment variable!

Even though the code had the correct default value, something was overriding it to the old address.

## ✅ **WHAT I FIXED:**

### 1. **Added Environment Variable**
Added to `backend/.env`:
```
LEASE_SIGNATURE_CONTRACT=0x60e3b0a49e04e348aA81D4C3b795c0B7df441312
```

### 2. **Killed ALL Node Processes**
- Used `taskkill /F /IM node.exe /T` to kill everything
- Cleared all caches

### 3. **Restarted Both Servers**
- Backend: Fresh start reading NEW env variable
- Frontend: Fresh webpack compilation
- **Both now running with UPDATED code**

## 🔍 **How to Verify:**

When you click "Sign Lease", check the backend console logs:

**You SHOULD see:**
```
📋 [ARC_CONTRACT] Signing lease on smart contract with Circle wallet
📍 Contract configuration: {
  CONTRACT_ADDRESS: '0x60e3b0a49e04e348aA81D4C3b795c0B7df441312',
  RPC_URL: 'https://rpc.testnet.arc.network'
}
```

**NOT:**
```
CONTRACT_ADDRESS: '0x1B831B4a95216ea98668BCEFf2662FEF2E833Da3' ❌
```

## 🧪 **Test Now:**

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl + Shift + F5)
3. **Go to lease review page**
4. **Click "Sign Lease"**
5. **Check backend terminal** for the contract address log

---

## 📊 **If It Still Shows Old Address:**

Then there might be an environment variable override. Check:

```bash
# In backend folder
Get-Content .env | Select-String "LEASE_SIGNATURE_CONTRACT"
```

If it shows the old address, update it:
```
LEASE_SIGNATURE_CONTRACT=0x60e3b0a49e04e348aA81D4C3b795c0B7df441312
```

```
