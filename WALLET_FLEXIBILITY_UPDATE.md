## üîÑ New User Flow

### Signup Flow
1. User fills signup form (NO wallet field)
2. Account created in auth.users
3. User record created in public.users (wallet_address = NULL)
4. User redirected to dashboard

### Wallet Connection Flow (On-Demand)

**Scenario 1: During Lease Signing**
1. User clicks "Sign Lease"
2. No wallet detected ‚Üí Modal appears
3. User chooses:
   - **Create New**: System creates Circle-managed wallet
   - **Connect Existing**: User enters their Arc address
4. Wallet saved to database
5. User can now sign lease

**Scenario 2: During Payment**
1. User clicks "Pay Now"
2. No wallet detected ‚Üí Modal appears
3. User connects wallet (same as above)
4. Payment proceeds with selected wallet

**Scenario 3: In Wallet Settings**
1. User goes to Wallet tab
2. Clicks "Connect Wallet" or "Add Wallet"
3. Modal appears with options
4. User manages wallets proactively

## üí° Wallet Types Supported

### 1. Circle-Managed Wallet (`walletType: 'circle'`)
**How It Works**:
- System creates wallet using Circle SDK
- Returns `walletId` (UUID) and `address` (0x...)
- Both stored in database
- System can initiate transactions on user's behalf

**Pros**:
- No setup required
- Always available
- Secure and reliable
- Recommended for most users

**Cons**:
- User doesn't have direct control
- Trust in Circle infrastructure

### 2. External Wallet (`walletType: 'external'`)
**How It Works**:
- User provides their own Arc wallet address
- Only `address` stored (no walletId)
- User must sign transactions themselves
- User manages their own keys

**Pros**:
- Full user control
- User owns their keys
- Can use existing wallet

**Cons**:
- User must have USDC on Arc
- User must manage wallet security
- More technical knowledge required

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### users Table Columns:
```sql
circle_wallet_id TEXT           -- NULL for external wallets
wallet_address TEXT             -- 0x... Arc address (for both types)
wallet_type TEXT                -- 'circle' or 'external'
```

### Wallet States:

**No Wallet Connected**:
```sql
circle_wallet_id: NULL
wallet_address: NULL
wallet_type: NULL
```

**Circle-Managed Wallet**:
```sql
circle_wallet_id: 'abc-123-def-456'
wallet_address: '0x1234...5678'
wallet_type: 'circle'
```

**External Wallet**:
```sql
circle_wallet_id: NULL
wallet_address: '0x9876...4321'
wallet_type: 'external'
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: New User Signup
1. Sign up with new account
2. **VERIFY**: No wallet address field in form
3. **VERIFY**: Account created successfully

2. Go to lease signing page OR wallet tab
3. Click "Connect Wallet"
4. **VERIFY**: Modal appears with 2 options
5. Click "Create New Wallet"
6. **VERIFY**: Success message shows wallet address
7. **VERIFY**: Database shows circle_wallet_id AND wallet_address

### Test 3: Connect External Wallet
1. Log in as user without wallet
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Choose "Connect Existing Wallet"
4. Enter Arc address: `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`

## üîê Security Considerations

### Circle-Managed Wallets:
- ‚úÖ Keys managed by Circle infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Non-custodial (Circle can't access funds without user)
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard security
- ‚úÖ Automatic transaction management

### External Wallets:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User must maintain wallet security
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lost keys = lost access (we can't help)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User responsible for funding wallet with USDC
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must have Arc Testnet network configured

## üìä Database Migration

**File**: `database/migrations/019_remove_wallet_from_signup_trigger.sql`

**YOU NEED TO RUN THIS IN SUPABASE**:

```sql
-- Remove wallet_address from signup trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.on_auth_user_created()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  user_role TEXT;
BEGIN
  user_role := COALESCE(
    (NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role')::TEXT,
    'prospective_tenant'
  );
  
  user_role := CASE user_role
    WHEN 'property_manager' THEN 'property_manager'
    WHEN 'manager' THEN 'manager'
    WHEN 'prospective_tenant' THEN 'prospective_tenant'
    WHEN 'tenant' THEN 'tenant'
    WHEN 'ai_agent' THEN 'ai_agent'
    ELSE 'prospective_tenant'
  END;

  INSERT INTO public.users (
    id,
    email,
    full_name,
    role,
    user_type,
    is_active,
    created_at,
    updated_at
  )
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    COALESCE((NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name')::TEXT, ''),
    user_role,
    user_role,
    TRUE,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  )
  ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE SET
    full_name = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.full_name, users.full_name),
    role = EXCLUDED.role,
    user_type = EXCLUDED.user_type,
    updated_at = NOW();

  RETURN NEW;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RAISE WARNING 'Error syncing user to public.users: %', SQLERRM;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **RUN** database migration in Supabase
2. **TEST** signup (should work without wallet)
3. **TEST** wallet connection modal
4. **TEST** payment with Circle wallet
5. **VERIFY** external wallet saving works

---

## üìù Notes

**Circle Wallet Creation**:
- Still uses `/api/arc/wallet/create` endpoint
- Creates wallet on-demand (not at signup)
- Saves to database when successful

**External Wallet Support**:
- Currently saves address to database
- Future: Implement external wallet transaction signing
- For now, external wallets are for receiving only

**Wallet Tab**:
- Should show wallet connection status
- Allow users to change wallets
- Display balance (for Circle wallets)

---

## üéâ Summary

**What Changed**:
- Removed automatic wallet creation
- Added user choice modal
- Support for external wallets
- On-demand wallet connection

**Result**:
Users now have **full flexibility** in wallet management while maintaining a **seamless payment experience**.

The system respects user choice while providing an easy path for those who want managed wallets! üöÄ
