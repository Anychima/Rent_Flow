# Fix Duplicate React Import Error

## Issue
Build error: "Identifier 'React' has already been declared"

## Root Cause
The PaymentSection.tsx file was created with React import, but the build cache wasn't cleared.

## Solution Applied
1. âœ… Verified file has only ONE React import (line 1)
2. âœ… Cleared build cache (`node_modules/.cache`)

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Restart Dev Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Option 2: Clear Cache and Rebuild
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm start
```

### Option 3: Full Clean (if issue persists)
```powershell
cd frontend
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build
npm start
```

## Verification
After restarting, the error should be gone. The file PaymentSection.tsx has the correct single import:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { CheckCircle, Clock, DollarSign, Loader } from 'lucide-react';
import axios from 'axios';
```

## Status
âœ… File is correct
âœ… Cache cleared
ðŸ”„ **Action Required**: Restart dev server to pick up changes

Simply stop the frontend dev server (Ctrl+C) and run `npm start` again.
