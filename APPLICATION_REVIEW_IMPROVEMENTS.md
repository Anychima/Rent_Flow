## 📋 New Component: ApplicationReviewModal

### **Purpose**
A standalone, reusable component for reviewing applications with enhanced AI analysis

### **Key Features**

#### **1. Enhanced AI Analysis Section**
```typescript
✅ Compatibility Score (0-100)
  - Green (75+): Excellent Match
  - Blue (60-74): Good Match  
  - Yellow (45-59): Fair Match
  - Red (<45): Poor Match

✅ Risk Score (0-100)
  - Green (<30): Low Risk
  - Yellow (30-59): Medium Risk
  - Red (60+): High Risk

✅ Income-to-Rent Ratio
  - Automatic calculation
  - Visual indicator if meets 3x requirement
```

#### **2. Detailed Information Sections**
- Applicant Information (name, email, employment, income, dates)
- Property Details (title, rent, address)
- Manager Notes (textarea for custom notes)

#### **3. Smart Action Buttons**
- Only show Approve/Reject for `submitted` or `under_review` status
- Disable buttons during processing
- Show status message for already-processed applications
- Rejection requires optional reason via prompt

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **Backend Endpoint** (`/api/applications/:id/status`)
**Status**: Already working correctly ✅

**What it does**:
1. Validates status value
2. Updates application record
3. Stores manager notes and reviewed_by
4. Returns updated application with joined data
5. Timestamps the review

### **Frontend Button Logic** (Fixed)

#### **Before** ❌:
```typescript
if (response.ok) {
  showToast('Application approved!', 'success');
  fetchData(); // Missing await
}
```

#### **After** ✅:
```typescript
const result = await response.json();
console.log('Approval response:', result);

if (result.success || response.ok) {
  showToast('Application approved successfully! ✅', 'success');
  await fetchData(); // Properly awaited
} else {
  showToast(result.error || 'Failed to approve', 'error');
  throw new Error(result.error);
}
```
