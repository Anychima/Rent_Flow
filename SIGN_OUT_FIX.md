# 🔧 Sign Out Issue - FIXED

**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Issue**: Sign out was getting stuck and logging twice  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Console Output Showed:**
```
🚪 [AuthContext] Signing out...
🚪 [AuthContext] Signing out...
```

**Root Cause:**
The [signOut](file://c:\Users\olumbach\Documents\Rent_Flow\frontend\src\contexts\AuthContext.tsx#L325-L380) function was being called **twice** due to React component re-rendering during the sign-out process. When `window.location.href = '/'` executes, it triggers a page reload which can cause React to re-mount components, potentially calling [signOut](file://c:\Users\olumbach\Documents\Rent_Flow\frontend\src\contexts\AuthContext.tsx#L325-L380) again before the redirect completes.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File Modified**: `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

### Change 1: Added Sign-Out Guard

Added a `sessionStorage` flag to prevent duplicate sign-out calls:

```typescript
const signOut = async () => {
  // Prevent double sign-out calls
  const signingOutFlag = sessionStorage.getItem('signing_out');
  if (signingOutFlag === 'true') {
    console.log('⚠️ [AuthContext] Sign out already in progress, skipping...');
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    // Set flag to prevent double calls
    sessionStorage.setItem('signing_out', 'true');
    console.log('🚪 [AuthContext] Signing out...');
    
    // ... rest of sign out logic ...
    
    window.location.href = '/';
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ [AuthContext] Error during sign out:', error);
    
    // Clear the signing out flag on error
    sessionStorage.removeItem('signing_out');
    
    // Still redirect on error
    window.location.href = '/';
  }
};
```

### Change 2: Clean Up Flag on Mount

Added cleanup in the [useEffect](file://c:\Users\olumbach\Documents\Rent_Flow\frontend\src\contexts\AuthContext.tsx#L100-L299) initialization to clear any stuck flags:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let mounted = true;
  let refreshInterval: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;
  let initializing = false;

  // Clear any stuck sign-out flag on mount
  sessionStorage.removeItem('signing_out');
  console.log('🧹 [AuthContext] Cleared any stuck sign-out flag');

  // ... rest of initialization ...
}, []);
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "Sign Out" button**
2. [signOut](file://c:\Users\olumbach\Documents\Rent_Flow\frontend\src\contexts\AuthContext.tsx#L325-L380) function checks `sessionStorage` for `signing_out` flag
3. If flag is `true`, function exits immediately (prevents double call)
4. If flag is not set, sets flag to `'true'` and proceeds with sign out
5. Supabase auth sign out is called
6. Local state is cleared
7. Page redirects to `/` (home page)
8. On next page load, flag is automatically cleared

**Error Handling:**
- If sign out fails, the flag is cleared before redirect
- This ensures the user isn't stuck and can try again

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior After Fix

**Console Output (Correct):**
```
🚪 [AuthContext] Signing out...
🧹 [AuthContext] Cleared cached auth data
✅ [AuthContext] Sign out complete
🔄 [AuthContext] Redirecting to home page...
```

**No more duplicate messages!**

---

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

1. **Login** to the application as any user
2. **Click "Sign Out"** button
3. **Check console** (F12) - should see sign out message only ONCE
4. **Verify** you're redirected to home page
5. **Verify** you're logged out (can't access protected routes)

---

## 🔍 Why Use sessionStorage Instead of State?

**Question**: Why not use React state to prevent double calls?

**Answer**: 
- `sessionStorage` persists across component re-renders
- React state can be reset during the sign-out redirect
- `sessionStorage` is automatically cleared when tab/window closes
- It provides protection even during the window reload process

---

## 📊 Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
   - Added sign-out guard with `sessionStorage` flag
   - Added flag cleanup on mount
   - Enhanced error handling to clear flag on failure

---

## ✅ Status

**Fix Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (Auto-reload via React dev server)

**Testing Required**: 
- ✅ Developer verified fix logic
- ⏳ User testing pending

**Next Steps**:
1. Try signing out again
2. Verify console shows only one "Signing out..." message
3. Confirm redirect to home page works
4. Confirm you're properly logged out

---

## 🚀 Ready to Test

The fix has been applied and the development server should have automatically picked it up. 

**Try signing out now** - it should work smoothly without getting stuck!

If you still experience issues, let me know and I'll investigate further.
