## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Payment section not showing"
→ Make sure you signed the lease with a wallet connected
→ Check browser console for errors
→ Verify backend is running

### "Chat not migrating"
→ Run the database migration script
→ Check backend logs for migration success
→ Verify lease has `application_id` field

### "Wallet disconnected after signing"
→ This is the old behavior
→ Make sure you pulled latest code
→ Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
