6. ✅ Tenant signs lease with Arc wallet → Blockchain signature recorded
7. ✅ Tenant makes payments via Arc Testnet → **REAL Circle API transactions**
8. ✅ Lease activates → Prospective tenant promoted to tenant
9. ✅ Tenant dashboard shows:
   - ✅ Signed lease with signature timestamps
   - ✅ Blockchain transaction hashes (clickable Arc Explorer links)
   - ✅ All payment records with transaction hashes
10. ✅ All activities recorded on-chain with real transaction hashes

## 🔧 What I Just Fixed

**Issue Found:** Signature timestamps were being saved to wrong database columns
- Backend was writing to: `tenant_signature_date` / `landlord_signature_date`
- Frontend was reading from: `tenant_signed_at` / `landlord_signed_at`

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated backend to use correct column names
- ✅ Backend server automatically reloaded with fix
- ✅ Created SQL migration script to fix existing data (if needed)

**Impact:** 
- **Before fix**: Signatures worked but timestamps didn't display (⏳ hourglass icon)
- **After fix**: Timestamps will display correctly (✅ checkmark with date)

## 📊 About Your Existing Test Data

**Obi Nwa's Lease (cc9ed39e-ba82-4cd4-9b50-ac3b5c6c0532):**
- Shows ⏳ hourglasses for signatures
- Has NO transaction hashes
- This is **EXPECTED** - this lease was created before blockchain integration

**What This Means:**
- Old test data is fine to keep (historical record)
- **For testing**: Create a fresh account and property
- New data will have ALL blockchain fields properly populated

- ✅ Copy buttons work

---

## ❌ What You Should NOT See (Errors)

### These Would Indicate Problems:

---

## 🗄️ Database Migration (OPTIONAL)

**If you want to fix your existing test data:**

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy timestamps from old columns to new columns
UPDATE leases 
SET tenant_signed_at = tenant_signature_date
WHERE tenant_signature_date IS NOT NULL
  AND tenant_signed_at IS NULL;

UPDATE leases 
SET landlord_signed_at = landlord_signature_date
WHERE landlord_signature_date IS NOT NULL
  AND landlord_signed_at IS NULL;
```

**Note:** This only affects old test data. New leases will work correctly without this.
