2. **No Environment Validation** - Silent failures possible
3. **Security Not Audited** - RLS policies need review
4. **Performance Not Optimized** - No code splitting or lazy loading

### Minor Issues
1. **Empty Files** - 4 placeholder files doing nothing
2. **Outdated TODOs** - 4 comments need resolution
3. **Mobile UX** - Could be more polished
4. **Accessibility** - Limited ARIA labels
